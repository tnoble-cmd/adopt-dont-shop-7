# 5. Add a Pet to an Application

# As a visitor
# When I visit an application's show page
# And I search for a Pet by name
# And I see the names Pets that match my search
# Then next to each Pet's name I see a button to "Adopt this Pet"
# When I click one of these buttons
# Then I am taken back to the application show page
# And I see the Pet I want to adopt listed on this application
